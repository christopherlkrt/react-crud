# Nave boilerplate

Boilerplate based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Start

Clone this repository and run `yarn` or `npm` to install dependencies.

## Running

`npm start` or `yarn start`

## Start [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)

json-server -p 4000 db.json

Port 4000 so it wont override react port and db.json file is at the root folder.
Also, you can add some delay by running "json-server -p 4000 -d 500 db.json and" see the list loading animation.

You are good to go now.

## Observation(s)

[SweetAlert](https://sweetalert.js.org/docs)
Used to give the user a return about his actions, choose sweetalert because it's a simple, smooth and good looking alert for pop up at user's screens
